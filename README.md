# Toast Notifications

A chrome plugin that connects with the Domain APIs to display toast notifications of new properties.

Upload your saved searches into the extension and it will poll your search queries periodically. When a new listing is returned, it will display a toast notification with a link to the listing!

Currently requires a callback and event listener to be present on the domain page to return relevant user data

TODO: pull cookie data in the extension itself and make all the required API cals
